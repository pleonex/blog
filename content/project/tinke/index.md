Tinke is a program to see, convert, and edit the files of NDS games.
You can see a lot of format files like images, text, sounds, fonts and textures.
Furthermore it works with plugins made in NET Framework languages
(C# and VB.NET) so it's so easy to support new formats.

## Features

 * Show the ROM header with the banner and edit it.
 * Show and convert to common format a lot of files.
 * Edit a lot of image files from BMP files (NCLR, NCGR, NSCR, NCER), audio files from WAV (SWAV, SWAR, STRM) and fonts (NFTR).
 * Hexadecimal visor.
 * Change the content of the files and save the new ROM.
 * Translated to multiple languages.
