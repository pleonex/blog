As a member of the GradienWords fan-translation group, I worked in my free time
as Localization Engineer to translate from Japanese to Spanish the game:
_"Ni no kuni: Shikkoku no Madoshi"_ for Nintendo DS.
In this altruistic project we did reverse engineering in the game to translate
all the text and images files as well as edit font files and assembly code.

### Programming

- Create programs to convert text, image, audio and font files in easy formats
  to edit like XML, TXT, PO, PNG, WAV files.
- Work together with translators and graphic editors to make easier to edit
  files and tools.
- Edit video game source code in assembly format (ARM) to adapt occidental text
  in the screen. This includes changing: text and image positions, keyboard,
  font char spaces and increasing text limits.
- Create build automation programs

### Reverse engineering

- Figure out file the binary format of text, script, image, font and audio files.
- Identify security algorithms (encryption, integrity and authentication) to
  modify DLC and save files.
