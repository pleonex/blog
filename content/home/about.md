# Biography

Benito Palacios (also known as *pleonex*) is a Software Engineer.
He studied Electrical Engineering with specialty in Telematics (network
infrastructure and protocols) in Granada, Spain. He really loves programming,
especially in **C#** and Python.

His hobby is reverse engineering of video games. In his free time, he works
with game fan-translation groups in a role of Localization Engineer figuring out
and creating programs to edit image and text files.

But, as Linus Torvalds [said](https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132)
_"Talk is cheap. Show me the code"_ so don't forget to _check out_ my personal
projects in [**Github (@pleonex)**](https://github.com/pleonex) and my
[C# style guidelines](https://github.com/SceneGate/Yarhl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-guidelines).
